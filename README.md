- Clear value separation (DM for routing, dashboard for detailed work)
- Mobile-optimized experience

**Example Interactions**:
- "Save this reel" → "Got it! Saving to your moodboard 👉 [link]"
- "Find producers in LA" → "I'll find LA producers for you! 👉 [link]"
- "Remind me to submit to playlists" → "Reminder created! 👉 [link]"
- "How are my stats?" → "I'll pull up your analytics! 📊 👉 [link]"

### Example Test Cases

**Instagram URL Sharing**:
```
User: "Check out this stage setup: https://instagram.com/p/CoolStage123/"
Bot: "I can see you've shared an Instagram post. While I can't access the content directly due to Instagram's platform restrictions, I'd love to help you analyze it! If you can describe what's in the post or share it as an image, I can provide specific feedback on stage design, lighting, and performance aesthetics. For now, I'll save this to your moodboard as inspiration."
```

**Image Analysis**:
```
User: [Shares concert poster image] "What do you think of this poster design?"
Bot: "Love the bold typography and color scheme! This definitely stands out. The venue/date hierarchy is clear, and the QR code for tickets is smart. A few quick thoughts:
1. The aesthetic matches your recent singles perfectly
2. Consider creating story-sized versions for easier sharing  
3. This style would work great for merch designs too

I'll add this to your moodboard and create tasks for social media rollout."
```
