# Instagram Content Processing Fix Summary

## Issue
When users share Instagram posts via DM, the system responds with a generic message asking for context instead of analyzing the actual Instagram content.

## Root Causes Identified
1. **System Prompt Issue**: The AI was explicitly told to "Never claim you can access Instagram content directly"
2. **URL Processing**: Instagram URLs were detected but not properly processed before sending to AI
3. **Image Analysis**: Instagram post images were not being analyzed with GPT-4 Vision
4. **API Error**: Recipient ID format issue causing 400 errors when sending responses

## Fixes Implemented

### 1. Enhanced URL Processing (`server/services/urlProcessor.ts`)
- Added Instagram oEmbed API integration for fetching post metadata
- Extracts post ID, type (post/reel/story), author, caption, and thumbnail
- Graceful fallback when API access is limited

### 2. Updated System Prompt (`server/services/mcBrain.ts`)
- Changed from "Never claim you can access Instagram content" to "You CAN analyze Instagram content!"
- Instructs AI to proactively analyze shared content without asking for descriptions
- Enhanced content extraction formatting for better AI understanding

### 3. Vision Integration (`server/services/visionAnalysis.ts`)
- Created vision analysis service for image processing
- Integrates with GPT-4 Vision API for analyzing images
- Extracts images from Instagram posts for analysis

### 4. Improved Message Processing (`server/routes.ts`)
- Added detailed logging for debugging
- Fixed recipient ID formatting issue (converting to string)
- Enhanced webhook processing with better error handling

### 5. Enhanced Content Context
- Instagram URLs are now processed to extract:
  - Post type (post, reel, story)
  - Post ID
  - Caption/description (when available)
  - Media URLs for image analysis
- All extracted content is formatted and passed to the AI for intelligent responses

## How It Works Now

1. **User shares Instagram post** → Webhook receives message
2. **URL Detection** → System identifies Instagram URLs in the message
3. **Content Extraction** → Attempts to fetch post data via oEmbed API
4. **Image Analysis** → If images are available, they're analyzed with GPT-4 Vision
5. **AI Processing** → All extracted content is formatted and sent to GPT-4
6. **Smart Response** → AI provides contextual feedback about the shared content

## Testing
To test the system:
1. Send an Instagram post URL via DM
2. The system should now:
   - Recognize it's an Instagram post
   - Attempt to extract content
   - Provide intelligent feedback
   - Offer to save to moodboard or provide career advice

## Environment Variables (Optional)
For enhanced Instagram content access, you can add:
```
FACEBOOK_APP_ID=<your_facebook_app_id>
FACEBOOK_APP_SECRET=<your_facebook_app_secret>
```

Without these, the system still works but with limited Instagram data access.
