# Instagram Content Analysis Fix - July 2025

## Problem
Instagram reels and posts shared via DM were not being analyzed. The system was receiving media attachments like `[IG_REEL: Sky hook 🏀🚽 (@roadtoflexico)]` but not processing the actual content.

## Root Cause
1. Instagram media shares come as attachments with metadata, not as URLs in the message text
2. The system wasn't recognizing these attachments as Instagram content
3. Media URLs from attachments weren't being analyzed with the Vision API

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Webhook Processing (`server/routes.ts`)
- Added detection for Instagram media attachments (ig_reel type or attachments with @ in title)
- Extract Instagram content metadata from media attachments
- Create synthetic message text when only media is shared
- Properly pass processed message text to mcBrain

### 2. Enhanced mcBrain Processing (`server/services/mcBrain.ts`)
- Added Instagram media detection in attachments
- Create synthetic Instagram content entries for media attachments
- Improved logging to show media attachments
- Enhanced message formatting to clearly identify Instagram content

### 3. Better Content Formatting
- Instagram reels/posts are now properly identified in the AI context
- Media URLs are extracted and can be analyzed with Vision API
- Clear differentiation between Instagram content and regular media

## How It Works Now

1. **User shares Instagram reel/post** → Attachment comes with type and title
2. **Webhook processing** → Detects Instagram pattern (ig_reel or @ in title)
3. **Content extraction** → Creates structured content entry with media URL
4. **Vision analysis** → Analyzes the media if URL is available
5. **AI processing** → GPT-4 receives full context about the Instagram content
6. **Smart response** → Provides specific feedback and saves to moodboard

## Testing
The system now properly handles:
- Instagram reels shared via DM
- Instagram posts with media
- Mixed content (text + Instagram media)
- Multiple Instagram shares

## Example Flow
```
User shares: Instagram Reel "Sky hook 🏀🚽 (@roadtoflexico)"
System detects: Instagram Reel with username
Processes: Creates Instagram content entry, analyzes media
Response: "I see you've shared an Instagram Reel from @roadtoflexico..."
```
